# Tom-Clark-CS-BEng-Project

This project takes a decentralised reinforcement learning approach to solve the competitive multi-agent Minimal Substrate environment.
3 experiments are made to see whether the issues of Loss of gradient, Focussing and Relativism appear when using reinforcement learning to solve this problem.
