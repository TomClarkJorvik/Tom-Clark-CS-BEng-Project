# Tom-Clark-CS-BEng-Project

This project is the repository for my 3rd year University project - "Exploring Problems with Competitive Multi-Agent Self-Play Reinforcement Learning through a Minimal Substrate".
The project dissertation can be provided upon request.

This project takes a decentralised reinforcement learning approach to solve the competitive multi-agent Minimal Substrate environment.
3 experiments are made to see whether the issues of Loss of gradient, Focussing and Relativism appear when using reinforcement learning to solve this problem.
